When you don't see video on cross networks.
Potential Causes:
- your Public IP might have changed. So, goto goole and see Public IP. If changed, go to
turnserver.conf file, and update latest public IP (i.e external-ip) and save it.
-If still its not running, 
Then open F660 ( your Router Login),
Goto application, see PORT FORWARDING. Update your local ip (ipconfig getifaddr en0  in MAC)
Ipconfig in windows

Now, you should be able to see - Video starts streaming on cross platforms.
Thank you
